            The conscious mind is known for being aware of active thoughts and actions. This part of the mind is responsible for decision making, responding to the world around us, acknowledging feelings, and interpreting input from our body and our surroundings. Even now as you are reading this your conscious mind is adding it to your inner dialogue as we speak… These memories are easier to pull out from the void, as we are not quite into the nitty gritty.

            Next is the subconscious. This part of the mind is responsible for storing received information and taking care of things we don’t always need to think about doing like breathing. It’s where thoughts that don’t constantly stay in the forefront of our minds stay. It is part of the core of our self-being and who we are. Here you will find it is a bit harder to navigate than the conscious part of the mind… Some things may be incomplete.
